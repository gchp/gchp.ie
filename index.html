  Hey, I'm Greg - welcome to my blog! This is where I occasionally write about my journey through the world of software development. Usually I'll write about tech I'm interested in, problems I encounter or things I'm working on. You can see the full list of posts below, or check out the <a href="/about/" title="more about me">about page</a> to find out more about me!
