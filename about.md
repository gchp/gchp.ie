My name is Greg Chapple, I'm from Dublin, Ireland where I live with my wife
Becky. I'm currently working for a company called
[Propylon](https://propylon.com) as a techincal architect. Before that I was
working as a senior software developer primarily working with Python & Django,
with a small bit of Javascript thrown in.

In my spare time I enjoy hacking on open-source projects like
[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust). I also work on a few pet projects
such as [iota](https://github.com/gchp/iota) which is a text-editor written
in Rust.

You can verify my identity on [my keybase page](https://keybase.io/gchp). If
you're looking for a keybase invite, I have some available - 
[tweet me](https://twitter.com/greg_chapple) if you want one.
